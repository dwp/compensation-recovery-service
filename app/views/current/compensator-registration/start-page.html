      <p class="govuk-body">Compensators who receive a claim for compensation must register the claim within 14 days.</p>
<p class="govuk-body"> Registering the claim does not mean that you have accepted liability for the accident or injury.
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      By registering a claim online, we can send your CRU certificate and NHS charges certificate to you by email.

        <p class="govuk-body">Do not use this service if:
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>your claim involves public liability, employer liability or clinical negligence</li>
            <li>the injured person received any NHS hospital treatment for their injuries, including an ambulance trip</li>
            <li>the injured person does not have a National Insurance Number</li>
          </ul>
<p class="govuk-body">You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-recovery-unit-forms">complete a CRU1 form</a> instead.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Registering online takes around 5 minutes.</p>
