  <p class="govuk-body">This service is for organisations that register compensation claims with the Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU). </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Register a claim online if:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>it is for motor or public liability</li>
            <li>the injured person is represented and can provide an email address for their representative</li>
            <li>the injured person did not receive hospital treatment as a result of the incident</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">It may be used by:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>insurance companies</li>
            <li>other compensators such as councils and government departments</li>
            <li>claim handlers</li>
            <li>solicitors and loss adjusters</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Create an administrator account for your organisation to register compensation claims</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your organisation must have an administrator account to register claims on this service. </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should check within your organisation to find out:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>if it already has an administrator account on this service</li>
            <li>if youâ€™re the right person to be an administrator</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">After creating an administrator account, you can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>register and manage claims</li>
            <li>take over existing claims from other organisations</li>
            <li>manage user accounts for people from your organisation who need to register compensation claims</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can sign in, if you already have an account for this service.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Other ways to register</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If a claim does not meet all of the above criteria, you will need to register it by post using a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ff7422ed3bf7f65d209c767/cru1.pdf">CRU1 form</a>. </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If you currently register claims through third party software</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">If your organisation manages compensation claims using software from CRIF, Direct Line Group or Experian, you should continue to register and manage claims through those. </p>
